First and foremost, note that the program currently only supports Windows 8+ 64-bit machines, as .NET 7+ no longer support Windows 7. If that does not apply to you, then make sure you've extracted the executable from the ZIP file before you've launched it, resolved your anti-virus, and have tried downloading the .NET Desktop Runtime mentioned under [installation instructions](https://github.com/pointfeev/CreamInstaller#installation) and restarting your computer. If none of the above work, then I simply cannot do anything about it, I do not control .NET. Either your system is not supported by the current version of .NET, or something is wrong/corrupted with your system.
