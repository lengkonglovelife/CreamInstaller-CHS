Make sure you've read the note under [Usage](https://github.com/pointfeev/CreamInstaller#usage)! Assuming the program functioned as it was supposed to by properly installing DLC unlockers to your chosen games, this is not an issue I can do anything about and it's entirely up to you to seek the appropriate resources to fix it yourself (hint: https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewforum.php?f=10).
